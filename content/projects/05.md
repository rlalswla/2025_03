# Overview

Built a modern, responsive portfolio website using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to showcase my development projects and technical skills. The site features dynamic content loading, smooth animations, dark/light mode theming, and optimized performance metrics.

## Features

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, dark mode & multi-language support
- Server-side rendering and static generation
- Data management through custom caching system
- Category-based filtering
- Projects - Study connections

## Challenges


### Data Fetching and Caching Optimization

Initially, I loaded all data as a single object directly from the client, which caused longer initial loading times as data grew.

To solve this, I restructured the architecture to utilize API Routes and implemented a system to request only necessary data (differentiating between summary and detailed data).

I built a custom in-memory caching system that reuses previously fetched data, preventing unnecessary API calls and improving the user experience when navigating between pages.


### Animation System

Developed a reusable animation system for page transitions and scroll-based animations that maintains smooth performance across different devices and doesn't interfere with accessibility features.


### Responsive Design System

Created a comprehensive responsive design system that maintains visual integrity across devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens, without any layout shifts or usability issues.
