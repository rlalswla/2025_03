# Overview

ON:U is a chat application built to facilitate communication between students and student council members. I focused on implementing real-time messaging using WebSocket and a custom caching system inspired by React Query.

## Features

- Project structure design and development environment setup
- OAuth login and registration, JWT-based authorization
- Real-time chat and chat room rendering with WebSocket, notification features
- Student opinion submission chat page (1-to-1 chat)
- Statistics page for student council to view various analytics
- Error handling and routing

## Challenges


### WebSocket Management

Used Zustand to manage socket instances globally, enabling automatic connections upon login.

Handled component-specific socket subscriptions using the Observer pattern.


### Asynchronous Data Management

Built a custom caching system inspired by React Query (tanstack query) to efficiently manage server state and real-time updates.


### Enhanced User Experience

Improved image upload speed through AWS S3 Presigned URL approach.
Implemented various features to enhance mobile-web compatibility, including PWA integration and viewport adjustments when keyboard appears.


### Error Handling

Implemented global error handling for API requests using Context API.
Displayed error messages to users via toast notifications and implemented appropriate error handling logic.
