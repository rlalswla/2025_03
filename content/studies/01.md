      Led a comprehensive technology selection process for the ON:U project, establishing a framework for evaluating and choosing appropriate libraries and frameworks.
      
      Selecting the right technology stack is one of the most critical decisions in any software project, with long-lasting implications for development efficiency, application performance, and long-term maintenance. For the ON:U project, we needed a technology stack that would support real-time features while ensuring a smooth user experience and developer productivity.
      
      Our technology selection process involved:
      
      1. Requirement Analysis: Identifying functional and non-functional requirements, with special attention to real-time communication needs, state management complexity, and mobile compatibility
      
      2. Technology Evaluation Framework: Creating a structured approach to evaluate technologies based on:
         - Performance metrics
         - Community support and ecosystem
         - Learning curve and team familiarity
         - Long-term maintenance considerations
         - Bundle size and load performance
         - Integration capabilities with other libraries
      
      3. Comparative Testing: Building small prototypes with various technology options to empirically evaluate their performance and developer experience
      
      4. Team Input: Gathering insights from all team members to ensure the selected technologies aligned with team skills and preferences
      
      Technology Selection Decisions:
      
      1. State Management: Zustand vs Redux
      
      We chose Zustand over Redux for several key reasons:
      - Bundle Size: Zustand added only 2.2KB to our bundle compared to Redux's 16KB (including react-redux and redux-toolkit)
      - API Simplicity: Zustand's API is significantly more straightforward, requiring fewer boilerplate files
      - Learning Curve: Team members without Redux experience could quickly adopt Zustand's intuitive approach
      - TypeScript Integration: Zustand provided better TypeScript support with fewer type annotations needed
      - Middleware Support: While Redux has a larger middleware ecosystem, Zustand offered the core capabilities we needed (persist, devtools)
      
      2. Styling Solution: Styled-Components vs Tailwind CSS
      
      After evaluating several options, we selected styled-components over Tailwind CSS:
      - Component Encapsulation: Better alignment with our React component architecture
      - Dynamic Styling: Superior support for styling based on props and theme variables
      - Scoped Styles: Eliminated style conflicts through automatic CSS-in-JS scoping
      - Developer Experience: Team was more familiar with CSS syntax than Tailwind's utility classes
      - Bundle Size Consideration: We implemented code splitting, making styled-components' larger initial size less impactful
      
      3. Routing: React Router vs TanStack Router
      
      We chose React Router despite TanStack Router's promising features:
      - Community Support: Much larger ecosystem and community resources
      - Maturity: Battle-tested in production environments with well-documented patterns
      - Learning Curve: Team's existing familiarity reduced development time
      - Feature Needs: Our routing requirements didn't necessitate TanStack Router's advanced features
      - Performance: Benchmarks showed minimal difference for our specific use cases (5% difference)
      
      4. Build Tool: Vite vs Create React App (CRA)
      
      Vite was selected over CRA due to:
      - Development Speed: Significantly faster hot module replacement and startup times
      - Modern Architecture: ESM-based approach with optimized production builds
      - Flexibility: Better support for various plugins and custom configurations
      - Build Performance: 60-70% faster builds in our testing compared to CRA
      - Active Development: More active maintenance and alignment with modern web standards
      
      This structured approach allowed us to make informed decisions that balanced immediate development needs with long-term maintenance and performance considerations.

## Code Example

```typescript

// Example of a client-side router comparison test
// Testing performance impact of different routing libraries

// React Router implementation
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function ReactRouterApp() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/chat/:id" element={<ChatPage />} />
        <Route path="/profile" element={<ProfilePage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// TanStack Router implementation
import {
  Router,
  RouterProvider,
  Route,
  RootRoute
} from '@tanstack/react-router';

const rootRoute = new RootRoute();

const homeRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/',
  component: HomePage
});

const chatRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/chat/$id',
  component: ChatPage
});

const profileRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/profile',
  component: ProfilePage
});

const notFoundRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '*',
  component: NotFoundPage
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  homeRoute,
  chatRoute,
  profileRoute,
  notFoundRoute
]);

const router = new Router({ routeTree });

function TanStackRouterApp() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

// Performance measurement code
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function BenchmarkTest() {
  const [reactRouterTime, setReactRouterTime] = useState(null);
  const [tanStackRouterTime, setTanStackRouterTime] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Measure React Router
    const reactRouterStart = performance.now();
    const reactRouterApp = document.createElement('div');
    ReactDOM.render(<ReactRouterApp />, reactRouterApp);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const reactRouterEnd = performance.now();
      setReactRouterTime(reactRouterEnd - reactRouterStart);
      ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(reactRouterApp);
    }, 500);
    
    // Measure TanStack Router
    const tanStackRouterStart = performance.now();
    const tanStackRouterApp = document.createElement('div');
    ReactDOM.render(<TanStackRouterApp />, tanStackRouterApp);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const tanStackRouterEnd = performance.now();
      setTanStackRouterTime(tanStackRouterEnd - tanStackRouterStart);
      ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(tanStackRouterApp);
    }, 500);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Router Performance Comparison</h2>
      <p>React Router render time: {reactRouterTime}ms</p>
      <p>TanStack Router render time: {tanStackRouterTime}ms</p>
      <p>Difference: {reactRouterTime && tanStackRouterTime ? 
        Math.abs(reactRouterTime - tanStackRouterTime).toFixed(2) + 'ms' : 
        'Calculating...'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Bundle size analysis for different state management libraries
import { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } from 'webpack-bundle-analyzer';

// Configuration for analyzing Zustand bundle size
const zustandWebpackConfig = {
  // ... other webpack configuration
  entry: './src/zustand-test.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'zustand-bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
      analyzerMode: 'static',
      reportFilename: 'zustand-report.html',
      openAnalyzer: false
    })
  ]
};

// Configuration for analyzing Redux bundle size
const reduxWebpackConfig = {
  // ... other webpack configuration
  entry: './src/redux-test.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'redux-bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
      analyzerMode: 'static',
      reportFilename: 'redux-report.html',
      openAnalyzer: false
    })
  ]
};

// Example of Zustand implementation for the comparison
// zustand-test.js
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 }))
}));

// Example of Redux implementation for the comparison
// redux-test.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Actions
const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
const decrement = () => ({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
    
```


## Application

This structured approach to technology selection was applied to the ON:U project, resulting in a well-balanced technology stack. Our selection of Zustand over Redux reduced our bundle size by approximately 14KB and significantly accelerated development due to its simpler API. The choice of styled-components aligned perfectly with our component-based architecture and enabled dynamic styling based on theme and user preferences. Selecting Vite as our build tool improved developer experience with 60% faster rebuilds during development and reduced average deployment time from 4 minutes to 1.5 minutes. These deliberate technology choices collectively improved both development velocity and end-user experience, with our application achieving a performance score increase from 76 to 89 in Lighthouse benchmarks.
