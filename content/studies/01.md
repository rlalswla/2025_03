## Why Technology Stack Considerations and Learning Are Important

I believe that deep understanding of any technology is crucial when implementing it. Using technologies with only superficial knowledge often leads to various problems and makes troubleshooting difficult when issues arise. Furthermore, knowing which technology is most effective in specific situations requires a deep understanding of underlying mechanisms, so I've strived to learn thoroughly about every technology I use.

My technology selection process followed these steps:

1. Requirements Analysis: Choices based on project functional and non-functional requirements such as real-time communication needs, state management complexity, and mobile compatibility.

2. Technology Evaluation Metrics: Technologies were evaluated based on:
   - Performance metrics
   - Community support and ecosystem
   - Learning curve and team familiarity
   - Long-term maintenance considerations
   - Bundle size and load performance
   - Integration capabilities with other libraries

## Technology Selection Decisions

### React

I concluded that no frameworks or libraries yet surpass React's powerful ecosystem. While other technologies certainly have their strengths, I decided that thoroughly mastering React would be most beneficial from a usage frequency perspective.

### Global State Management: Zustand

#### Why Not Context API

The Context API with useState for state management and triggering re-renders has several issues:

1. **Performance Issues**: Context API causes re-renders in all subscribed components when Provider values change, potentially leading to severe performance degradation when states change frequently or many components subscribe.

2. **Separation of Concerns Difficulty**: Including multiple states and functions in a single Context causes unnecessary re-renders, while separating into multiple Contexts complicates code and creates "Provider Hell" with nested Providers.

3. **State Update Logic Problems**: Managing complex state update logic within Context makes code complicated and difficult to maintain.

4. **Testing Difficulties**: Components using Context require wrapping with Providers for unit testing, necessitating additional setup.

5. **Middleware Support Limitations**: Context API doesn't inherently provide middleware features like logging, debugging, or persistence for state changes.

Based on these considerations, I opted for a global state management library and chose Zustand over Redux for these reasons:

- Bundle size: Zustand adds only 2.2KB to the bundle compared to Redux's 16KB (including react-redux and redux-toolkit)
- API simplicity: Zustand's API is significantly simpler and requires fewer boilerplate files
- Learning curve: Team members without Redux experience could quickly adopt Zustand's intuitive approach
- TypeScript integration: Zustand provides better TypeScript support with fewer type annotations
- Middleware support: While Redux has a larger middleware ecosystem, Zustand provided all the core features we needed (persist, devtools)

## Styling Solution: Styled-Components vs Tailwind CSS

I evaluated different libraries for various projects and studied their underlying mechanisms.

### How Styled-Components Works

Styled-Components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows writing CSS within JavaScript code. It combines React components with styles to encapsulate styles at the component level.

CSS is written within JavaScript code, with styles defined alongside components.
Styles are applied to the DOM through dynamically generated unique class names.
Dynamic styling:

Conditional styling based on React props is easily implemented.
Themes can be used to simply apply global styling (e.g., dark mode).
Scoping:

Styles are encapsulated within components, preventing style conflicts with other components.

### How Tailwind CSS Works

Tailwind CSS is a utility-class-based CSS framework designed for rapid styling using predefined CSS classes.

Tailwind provides predefined CSS utility classes (e.g., text-center, bg-blue-500, p-4, etc.).
Styles are applied by adding classes to HTML elements.

Styles are defined directly in HTML class names, eliminating the need for CSS files.
Unlike CSS-in-JS, styles are separated from JavaScript code.
Customization:

Tailwind's configuration file (tailwind.config.js) allows customizing colors, spacing, fonts, and more.
Unnecessary utility classes can be removed to reduce bundle size (using PurgeCSS).

### Selection Criteria

I primarily used Tailwind CSS for responsive web projects due to its excellent responsive and dynamic adaptation capabilities.
For styled-components, I preferred it for larger projects (finding it more readable and advantageous for team collaboration) or adaptive web projects.

## Server State Management: React Query (TanStack)

I recognized that client state and server state have fundamentally different characteristics requiring separate management approaches. Efficient server state management was particularly important in projects with real-time features like chat.

### Implementation Experience

After determining the need for server state management in the project, rather than simply using React Query, I challenged myself to implement a custom server state management system tailored to our requirements, which deepened my understanding of the underlying principles.
(Detailed information available in the associated learning page)

### Reasons for Choosing React Query

Server state specialization: React Query is a library specialized for server data management, comprehensively providing features necessary for server state management including caching, synchronization, updates, and error handling.

Declarative data fetching: The useQuery and useMutation hooks enable declarative handling of data fetching and state management, allowing concise writing of complex asynchronous logic.

Automated background updates: Options like staleTime and refetchOnWindowFocus can be utilized to configure automatic updates to maintain the latest state of server data.

Powerful caching mechanism: Performance is optimized by preventing duplicate requests for the same data and efficiently utilizing cached data.

Pagination and infinite scroll support: Large volumes of data, such as chat history, can be efficiently loaded through useInfiniteQuery.

## Routing: React Router vs TanStack Router

Despite TanStack Router's promising features, I chose React Router for these reasons:

- Community support: Much larger ecosystem and community resources
- Maturity: Proven in production environments with well-documented patterns
- Learning curve: Reduced development time due to team's existing familiarity
- Feature requirements: Our routing requirements didn't necessitate TanStack Router's advanced features
- Performance: Benchmark tests showed minimal differences in specific use cases (approximately 5% difference)

## Build Tool: Vite vs Create React App (CRA)

I chose Vite over CRA for most projects for these reasons:

- Development speed: Significantly faster hot module replacement and startup times
- Modern architecture: ESM-based approach with optimized production builds
- Flexibility: Better support for various plugins and custom configurations
- Build performance: Tests showed 60-70% faster build speeds compared to CRA
- Active development: More active maintenance and alignment with modern web standards

## Animation: Framer Motion

The main reason for introducing Framer Motion into the project was AnimatePresence, a powerful feature that provides a unique mechanism for applying animations when components are removed from the DOM.

### How AnimatePresence Works

AnimatePresence is a special component that connects React's lifecycle with animations, operating through the following process:

Component tracking: AnimatePresence continuously tracks child components, detecting when they are mounted or unmounted.

Unmount delay: Typically, when a component is removed by conditional rendering in React, it immediately disappears from the DOM, but AnimatePresence delays this, keeping the component in the DOM until animations complete.

Exit animation triggering: When a component needs to be removed, it executes the animation defined in the exit property, only removing it from the DOM after this animation completes.

Key-based transitions: Each child component is given a unique key attribute, allowing React to accurately track the creation and removal of components.
