        While developing a portfolio website, I gained a deep understanding of Next.js's App Router architecture and React Server Components (RSC).
        
        Unlike the previous Pages Router, App Router provides file system-based routing with built-in features like hierarchical layouts, 
        nested routing, loading states, and error handling. This allowed me to create a more intuitive and manageable routing structure.
        
        React Server Components are rendered on the server and transmitted as HTML, unlike traditional client components. This reduces 
        JavaScript bundle size and improves initial loading performance. I was able to significantly enhance data fetching, SEO optimization, 
        and initial page load performance using this technology.
        
        Key learning areas:
        
        1. Differences between server components and client components, and use cases for each
        
        2. Data fetching patterns:
           - Direct data fetching in server components
           - Data fetching through API routes
           - Client-side data fetching using SWR/React Query
        
        3. Performance optimization techniques:
           - Appropriate use of static and dynamic rendering
           - Selective hydration and streaming
           - Caching strategies through Route Segment Config options
        
        4. Advanced routing patterns such as parallel routes, intercepting routes, and route groups
      

## Key Takeaways

- Balanced design between server and client components
- File-based routing architecture with App Router
- Performance optimization using server components
- Application of parallel and intercepting route patterns
- Client-side navigation optimization
- Next.js caching mechanisms and revalidation strategies


## Code Example

```typescript

// Server Component Example
// app/projects/page.tsx
import { ProjectCard } from '@/components/project-card';

// Direct data fetching in server component
async function getProjects() {
  const res = await fetch('/api/portfolio/projects');
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch projects');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function ProjectsPage() {
  // Can use async/await directly
  const projects = await getProjects();
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {projects.map(project => (
        <ProjectCard key={project.id} project={project} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

// Client Component Example
// components/project-card.tsx
"use client"; // Mark as client component

import { useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

export function ProjectCard({ project }) {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <motion.div
      whileHover={{ y: -5 }}
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
    >
      {/* Card content */}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
      
```


## Application

I built a portfolio website using this Next.js App Router architecture and server components. By using server components for pages that require data fetching, I minimized JavaScript bundle size, while using client components only for interactive elements to optimize overall performance and user experience. I implemented overlay UIs like image modals using parallel routes and created smooth transitions from project lists to detail pages with intercepting routes.
