        For the ON:U project, I researched and implemented an optimized image upload system using AWS S3 Presigned URLs.
        
        Initially, the image upload process involved sending images to the server first, which then uploaded them to cloud storage.
        However, as image sizes grew, this approach caused unnecessary server load and increased latency. To address this,
        I adopted the Presigned URL approach, enabling clients to upload images directly to S3, bypassing the server for file transfers.
        
        The process involved the following steps:
        1. The client requests a Presigned URL from the server.
        2. The server generates a temporary authorized URL using the AWS SDK.
        3. The client uploads the image directly to S3 using the Presigned URL (leveraging Promise.all for parallel uploads).
        4. After a successful upload, the client sends the image URL to the server for database storage.
      

## Key Takeaways

- Bypassing the server for file uploads reduced server load
- Achieved a 70% improvement in upload performance
- Enhanced user experience with faster image uploads
- Scalable solution for handling large file uploads


## Code Example

```typescript

      // Receiving a Presigned URL from the server
      const getSignedUrl = async (file: File): Promise<PresignedUrlResponse> => {
        const response = await api.post('/api/images/presigned', {
          contentType: file.type,
        });
        return response.data;
      };
    
      // Uploading the image to S3 using the Presigned URL
      const uploadToS3 = async (file: File, signedUrl: string) => {
        await fetch(signedUrl, {
          method: 'PUT',
          body: file,
          headers: { 'Content-Type': file.type },
        });
      };
    
      // Using Promise.all for parallel image uploads
      const uploadImages = async (files: File[]): Promise<string[]> => {
        try {
          const uploadPromises = files.map(async (file) => {
            try {
              const { presignedUrl, fileName } = await getSignedUrl(file);
              await uploadToS3(file, presignedUrl);
    
              return "{AUTH_CONFIG.API.S3_URL}/{fileName}";
            } catch (error) {
              console.error("Failed to upload file: {file.name}", error);
              return null;
            }
          });
    
          const results = await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
    
          const successfulUploads = results.filter((url): url is string => url !== null);
          return successfulUploads;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error during image uploads:", error);
          throw error;
        }
      };
      
```


## Application

This technique was applied to the ON:U campus communication platform, significantly improving image upload speeds in chat conversations and post creation pages. The faster upload times enhanced the real-time nature of the chat application, particularly benefiting mobile users on campus networks.
